All the solutions have been written in Javascript.
The Frog and The Game have got 2 external libs: Angular JS v1.3 and Bootstrap v3.0. 
These libs were used to improve the user interface.

Instructions:

The root folder (Renata_SP) has 4 projects:
1 - The Game / 2 - The Frog
 	You should open the file "index.html" in your browser to run the apps in each project. These projects have been organized as "Stereotyped Style": components with same types are in the same folder.
3 - Binary Tree
	You should run the file "binaryTree.js". The "isValidBST" function is reponsible to verify if the tree is a valid binary search tree.
4 - Closures
	You should open the file "index.html" in your browser. The bugs in the registerHandlers function were fixed (file "closures.js"). An alert is been displayed anchor's zero-based index within a document instead of following the link.
